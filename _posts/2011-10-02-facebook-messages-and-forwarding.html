<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So, anyone that knows me knows that I don't really like Facebook. I don't really trust them as a company and I don't like having to go to their website all the time to see notifications and more specifically to see messages. I have an email. ONE email that I use (other than work). If I have any other email addresses they still end up in the same one location. Therefore I don't log into 5 places to check different emails. This is the way I like it. Reduces wasted time. Now with that said, Facebook has all ways been this nuisance for the simple fact that it's another form of email in a different location.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Well to make a long story short-er, I finally decided to do something about the messaging tonight. I decided that if I can't fix it then I'm getting rid of my Facebook. I started by trying to just disable it. I have an email and it's posted on my profile. If anyone needs it then they can find it there. I found that you can't do that. So then I looked to see if there was a way to just forward my messages to my email. We'll there wasn't a "forward" setting, however I did turn on notifications for messages (and messages only, I hate it when Facebook fills up my inbox). Well I had my wonder wife send me a message after I did this. I then received this email:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1lTirqdlzio/TokaNWVO0VI/AAAAAAABQKc/yU_4T7MVqmo/s1600/facebook.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1lTirqdlzio/TokaNWVO0VI/AAAAAAABQKc/yU_4T7MVqmo/s1600/facebook.png" /></a></div><br />Reply to the message?! Ok, let's see if this works. So I did and she got the message back. I guess this is a solution for my messaging&nbsp;dilemma. I've cleaned up most of the personal info on my account, so I think for now I'll just stay logged out of my Facebook account. I'll still get your messages and I'll reply (thanks to my email). However, I'm not going to log in for a while. See if I really miss it. I mean, if you really want to get a hold of me then you've got my email and twitter. Oh and don't forget that other social network, Google+.
