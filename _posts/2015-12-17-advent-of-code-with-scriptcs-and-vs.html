Once I got around to attempting to solve the riddles, I really wanted to use C#...without Visual Studio.<br /><br />And everyone and their family, that has an interest in coding, knows about <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>. I've also been reading about&nbsp;<a href="http://scriptcs.net/" target="_blank">scriptcs</a>&nbsp;but never really had a use for it. That is, until now. So I jumped out and quickly <a href="https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Installation" target="_blank">installed it</a>. Then thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/filip_woj" target="_blank">Filip W</a> and his blog post on the <a href="http://www.strathweb.com/2015/11/running-c-scripts-and-snippets-in-visual-studio-code-with-scriptcs/" target="_blank">scriptcs extension for VS Code</a>, I was able to quickly and easily use it.<br /><br />So here's the solution for Day 1:<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="750" src="https://dotnetfiddle.net/Widget/0t3CnZ" width="100%"></iframe>
