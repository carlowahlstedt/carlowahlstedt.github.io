We recently bought a new place of residence (and already sold the previous one thankfully). After getting our first full electric bill that equaled the bill from our other house (the new house has gas heat and the old one had electric), I decided I should look into the amount of money we're spending on lighting the house.<br /><br />I quickly remembered <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SavingMoneyOnLightingTheNewHouse.aspx" target="_blank">a blog post</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>&nbsp;about the cost of lighting. I downloaded his template but since I don't use Microsoft Office (because I use Google Docs) I needed to convert it to a Google Spreadsheet. After doing that I decided to make it my own. After I did that, I decided to make it a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AohqXRtakeaNdGJ3ZWxiYXlFSERsNmZFeG9ob3NsRWc&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Doc Template</a> to share with the world. I feel like <a href="http://thewahlstedts.blogspot.com/2011/08/loan-amortization-google-docs-template.html" target="_blank">my previous template</a>&nbsp;has been a relative success (1,422 users at current count). Enjoy!<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xpqcBgLkX5U/UT1A6JzdSII/AAAAAAABjiE/VZoAqjoeoL0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-03-10+at+10.26.22+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xpqcBgLkX5U/UT1A6JzdSII/AAAAAAABjiE/VZoAqjoeoL0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-03-10+at+10.26.22+PM.png" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />
