If you're reading this post you surely already know what <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/video-splash/?utm_source=spotify&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=start" target="_blank">spotify</a> is. At least <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/04/facebook-175-million-people-use-spotify.html" target="_blank">17.5 million people</a> must know what it is, well at least they've signed up for it. Needless to say, it's an awesome service. However, I don't have any desire to pay $8 a month to use it because I've never been much of a music purchaser. I'd rather listen to the radio, get a CD and wear it out, or borrow from someone. However, I do really enjoy music.<br /><br />So, now that my house has speakers installed throughout I've been looking for a way to control the music without having to walk to the receiver where whatever device is plugged in to turn it on or change the song. That's where spotify comes in specifically when paired with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jbl.android.spotimote&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">spotimote</a>. It's super simple to setup (so much so that you can just read the description on the app). Within no time, I had my <a href="http://thewahlstedts.blogspot.com/2011/08/giada-a50-nettop.html" target="_blank">Giada A50</a>&nbsp;playing music throughout my house with just the control of any Android device in no time.<br /><br />However, during the search I found a bonus item <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.georgie.SoundWireFree" target="_blank">SoundWire</a>. I had been wanting to listen to spotify, while at home, on a mobile device through headphones. You know, while doing some work around the house or one of those early mornings when the wife's still in the bed (which doesn't happen as much these days). SoundWire has you back in that regard. It will push audio from your media center device to any Android device via the app. It's pretty awesome.
