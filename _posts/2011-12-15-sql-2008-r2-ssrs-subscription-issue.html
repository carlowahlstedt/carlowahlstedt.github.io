<b>When a user with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms159864.aspx">Browser role</a>&nbsp;added a subscription, it would fail when sending an email.</b><br /><br />I recently had this issue with SSRS Subscriptions in SQL 2008 R2.&nbsp;My initial search landed me in an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms159155.aspx">MSDN article</a> that seemed to be telling me:<br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in;"><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #eeeeee; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">If you are using an SMTP server or forwarder that uses e-mail accounts that are different from the domain user account, the report delivery will fail when the SMTP server tries to deliver the report to that user.</span></span><o:p></o:p></div><br />Based on this, I submitted this information to our network guys to make sure this wasn't the issue (as I don't manager our mail server). However, I continued to search for a solution because the above reason didn't really seem like it was the actual issue.<br /><br />Then, as I read on down the article, I saw set number 3 in the section where I pulled the comment from above. It made me think that maybe if I set the&nbsp;DefaultHostName property to our domain name then it might fix the issue. Voil√† the subscriptions started working!<br /><br />Shortened version of the steps:<br /><br /><ol><li>On your SSRS R2 server open: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportServer\rsreportserver.config"</li><li>Find the property:&nbsp; DefaultHostName</li><li>Add your domain name in that property.</li></ol>
