<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I've been having an issue recently and I just decided to try to address it today. It was on a development server so I wasn't that concerned with it. My problem was that when errors were happening it wasn't sending out an email letting me know. I check the job to make sure that it was setup to email the error. It was. So then after a little searching I found that in the SQL Server Agent properties there's a setting to enable the mail profile. This wasn't enabled. Once I enabled it and restarted the agent all worked well! Easy fix!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tVafoRfu3mo/Tonq7xuB3AI/AAAAAAABQKg/dk_14wJNygo/s1600/sql+server+agent.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tVafoRfu3mo/Tonq7xuB3AI/AAAAAAABQKg/dk_14wJNygo/s1600/sql+server+agent.png" /></a></div><br /><br />
